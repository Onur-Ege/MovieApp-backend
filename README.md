# üé¨ Movie App - Backend

This is the backend of a full-stack **Movie Recommendation System** that leverages **graph-based algorithms**, **machine learning**, and **user interactions** to provide personalized movie suggestions.

The project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern for clean separation of concerns:
- **Model**: Neo4j graph entities and data transfer objects
- **View**: Not applicable (API backend only) [kotlin app](https://github.com/Onurege00/MovieApp)
- **Controller**: Spring REST controllers handle incoming requests and route them to services
- **Service Layer**: Business logic, data aggregation, and processing
- **Repository Layer**: Custom Cypher queries and Neo4j interaction

## üìä AOP: Logging & Performance Monitoring

We use **Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** to log and monitor:

- ‚úÖ Request method execution times
- ‚úÖ executed methods logs to debug easily
- ‚úÖ Performance of service methods

All major service and controller methods are wrapped using custom AOP aspects, improving visibility and diagnostics.
